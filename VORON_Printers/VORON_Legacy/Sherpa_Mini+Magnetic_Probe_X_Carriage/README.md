Sherpa Mini Toolhead for the Voron Legacy 3D printer

The PL probe has been changed to a microswitch probe. This allows for better packaging and the nozzle to be closer to the rods then the original toolhead. 
A bigger rear exhaust has also been realized for the hotend cooling fan. All toolheads such as the Dragon/Mosquito/V6 are supported.
Additionally the toolhead has a build in cable clamp for the umbilical inspired by discord user Edwardyeeks.

Sherpa Mini Toolhead for the Voron Legacy 3D printer

The PL-0X probe has been changed to a microswitch probe. This allows for better packaging and the nozzle to be closer to the rods then the original toolhead. 
For pickup detection probe_query or a circuit with the dock can be made. Crimp two male SM2.54 on a cable to connect the magnets of the x carriage.
A bigger rear exhaust has also been realized for the hotend cooling fan. All toolheads such as the Dragon/Mosquito/V6 are supported.

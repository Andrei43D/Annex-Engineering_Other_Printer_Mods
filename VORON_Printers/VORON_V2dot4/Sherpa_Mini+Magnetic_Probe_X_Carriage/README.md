Sherpa Mini Toolhead for the V2.4 3D printer

This carriage is compatible with both microswitch endstops and hall effect board. Both IGUS and Generic cable chains are supported. 
The PL-0X probe has been changed to a microswitch probe. This new probe is completely solderless and has many benefits such as actually probing the surface of the buildplate. The dock can be mounted stationary or onto the gantry (See the experimental folder).
For pickup detection probe_query or a circuit with the dock can be made. Crimp two male SM2.54 on a cable to connect the magnets of the x carriage.
No buildvolume is lost since the probe can be docked in the 10mm y overtravel of the V2.4. A bigger rear exhaust has also been realized for the hotend cooling fan. All toolheads such as the Dragon/Mosquito/V6 are supported.

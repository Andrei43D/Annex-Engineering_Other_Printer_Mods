Sherpa Mini Toolhead for the V2.4 3D printer

This carriage is compatible with both microswitch endstops and hall effect board. Both IGUS and Generic cable chains are supported. 
The PL probe has been changed to a microswitch probe. This new probe is completely solderless and has many benefits such as actually probing the surface of the buildplate. 
A bigger rear exhaust has also been realized for the hotend cooling fan. All toolheads such as the Dragon/Mosquito/V6 are supported.
